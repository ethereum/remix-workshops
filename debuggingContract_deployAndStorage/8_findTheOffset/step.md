# Find the offset ;)

Here is a simple test:

 - Deploy `simpleStore`
 - Debug the creation transaction
 - Find the value of the parameter of `CODECOPY` which represent the offset in calldata where to copy from

 Remember that we are talking about the `CODECOPY` which extract the bytes which will be stored on chain ;)

 - In the `findTheOffset` contract and `offset` function, please return the value you have found. Replace the `hex"00"` by your finding
 
 Good Lack!
