# This is a repo of tutorials for the Remix's LearnEth Plugin


### To use these tutorials:


**1. Open Remix**

https://remix.ethereum.org

**2. In the plugin manager activate LEARNETH**

**3. Go to the Learneth plugin and these tutorials will load by default**

**4. For questions**

https://gitter.im/ethereum/remix-workshop

We are here to help.


**5. You may need to sign into Github**

Github will block too many requests from the same location - unless you are signed into github and input a token.  This is only an issue during workshops - but because we are in a workshop, we need to do these steps:

    - In one browser window - go to remix.ethereum.org and go to the settings tab
    - In another browser window go to: 
    
    https://github.com/settings/tokens 
    
    and create a new token and save it in Remix in the you just opened on the settings tab.
