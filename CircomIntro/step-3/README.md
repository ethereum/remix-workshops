Let's write a simple Circom circuit.

## Creating a New Circuit File

1. In the **File Explorer** on the left sidebar, click on the **Create New File** icon.
2. Name your file `multiplier.circom` and press **Enter**.

## Writing the Circuit

Open `multiplier.circom` and add the following code:

```circom
pragma circom 2.0.0;

template Multiplier() {
    signal input a;
    signal input b;
    signal output c;

    c <== a * b;
}

component main = Multiplier();
```

## Explanation:
- template `Multiplier()`: Defines a new circuit template called Multiplier.
- `signal input a;` and `signal input b;`: Declare input signals a and b.
- `signal output c;`: Declare an output signal c.
- `c <== a * b;`: Constrain c to be the product of a and b.
- `component main = Multiplier();`: Instantiates the Multiplier circuit as main, which is required for the compiler.

### NB:
Signals are values in a cryptographic circuit that are strictly determined by the circuit's equations and constraints. Think of a signal as a value that must follow specific mathematical rules defined by the circuitâ€”once set, it can't be changed arbitrarily. In regular programming, variables are flexible and can be updated or reassigned as needed, whereas, signals can't be altered freely.
