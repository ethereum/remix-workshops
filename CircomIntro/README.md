So i have a workshops repository that has a folder structure in levels for the tutorials. The folder structure are in levels that are further explained below.
Level 1: Workshop name
Level 2: This level is a child folder of level 1 and contains a readme that gives a brief overview of the tutorial. This directory also has a config.yml file that has config content of
id: tutoriaId
name: Tutorial Name
summary: Tutorial summary
level: 1 (difficulty level with 1 as beginner and 3 as advanced)
tags: 
  - (related tags)
steps:
  - name: Intro to tutorial
    path: folder name of tutorial on the same level as level 2 where the readme and config.yml are present. This folder contains tutorial resources. A readme.md file in this folder contains the tutorial for that step. It contains an images folder to reference images for that tutorial step.
- name: Another tutorial step
   path: path to another tutorial step

The steps repeats itself until the tutorial is completed.
With the information above, write a tutorial on circom for beginners using Remix-IDE as the tool for practice. Remix-IDE has a plugin called 'circuit-compiler' that compiles circom code with different compiler versions available through a dropdown. It also has a checkbox option to enable "auto compile". it also has a checkbox option for "Hide warnings". There is an advanced configuration section in the plugin that provides a selection dropdown to choose the Prime to use for compiling circom. The UI has a compile button and as soon as compilation is successful, the Setup and Exports section is visible and the user can run a trusted setup by choosing between groth16 or plonk and export verification key or verification contract. There is also a dropdown to choose the appropriate power of tau file for running a trusted setup. After a successful setup and exports completion, the compute witness section and the generate proof section are then visible, where the user can enter inputs based on his circuit to compute a witness. They input fields are dynamically generated based on the number of inputs in the circuit. The generate proof section has a checkbox to export verifier calldata for onchain verification and a generate proof button that when clicked will generate the proof and export verifier calldata if enabled.
