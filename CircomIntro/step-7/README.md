With the witness computed, the final step is to generate a proof that can be verified by others.

## Generating the Proof

1. In the **Generate Proof** section, you have the option to **Export Verifier Calldata**.
   - Enable the **Export Verifier Calldata** checkbox if you plan to verify the proof on-chain.
2. Click on the **Generate Proof** button.

## Understanding the Output

- After generating the proof, the plugin will display the proof data.
- If you enabled **Export Verifier Calldata**, it will also provide the calldata needed for on-chain verification.

## Next Steps

- **Verification:** You can use the verification key or contract exported earlier to verify the proof.
- **On-Chain Verification:** If you're familiar with smart contracts, you can deploy the verification contract and use the calldata to perform on-chain verification.

**Congratulations!** You've successfully written a Circom circuit, compiled it, performed a trusted setup, computed a witness, and generated a proof using Remix-IDE.
