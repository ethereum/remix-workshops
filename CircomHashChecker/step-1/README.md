In this tutorial, we'll explore the **Hash Checker** circuit, a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) application using Circom and Remix-IDE. The Hash Checker circuit allows you to prove knowledge of certain inputs that hash to a given value without revealing the inputs themselves.

### What You'll Learn

- How to generate a Hash Checker circuit using Remix-IDE's workspace templates.
- Understanding the Circom code for hashing and checking hashes.
- Performing a trusted setup using Groth16.
- Generating zero-knowledge proofs.
