In this section, we will create our first _smart contract_. This contract only consists of a string that holds the value "Hello World!".

In the first line, we should specify the license that we want to use. You can find a comprehensive list of licenses here: <a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/" target="_blank">https://spdx.org/licenses/</a>.

Using the `pragma` keyword (line 3), we specify the Solidity version we want the compiler to use. In this case, it should be greater than or equal to `0.8.3` but less than 0.9.0.

We define a contract with the keyword `contract` and give it a name, in this case, `HelloWorld` (line 5).

Inside our contract, we define a _state variable_ `greet` that holds the string `"Hello World!"` (line 6).

Solidity is a _statically typed_ language, which means that you need to specify the type of the variable when you declare it. In this case, `greet` is a `string`.

We also define the _visibility_ of the variable, which specifies from where you can access it. In this case, it's a `public` variable that you can access from inside and outside the contract.

Don't worry if you didn't understand some concepts like _visibility_, _data types_, or _state variables_. We will look into them in the following sections.

To help you understand the code, we will link in all following sections to video tutorials from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWh7F3AFyQ_x01VKzr9eyA" target="_blank">creator</a> of the Solidity by Example contracts.

## ⭐️ Assignment

1. Delete the HelloWorld contract and its content.
2. Create a new contract named "MyContract".
3. The contract should have a public state variable called "name" of the type string.
4. Assign the value "Alice" to your new variable.
