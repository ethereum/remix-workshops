There are three different types of variables in Solidity: _State Variables_, _Local Variables_, and _Global Variables_.

## 1. State Variables

_State Variables_ are stored in the contract _storage_ and thereby on the blockchain. They are declared inside the contract but outside the function.
This contract has two state variables, the string `text`(line 6) and the uint `num` (line 7).

## 2. Local Variables

_Local Variables_ are stored in the _memory_ and their values are only accessible within the function they are defined in. Local Variables are not stored on the blockchain.
In this contract, the uint `i` (line 11) is a local variable.

## 3. Global Variables

_Global Variables_, also called _Special Variables_, exist in the global namespace. They don't need to be declared but can be accessed from within your contract.
Global Variables are used to retrieve information about the blockchain, particular addresses, contracts, and transactions.

In this example, we use `block.timestamp` (line 14) to get a Unix timestamp of when the current block was generated and `msg.sender` (line 15) to get the caller of the contract function’s address.

A list of all Global Variables is available in the <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/cheatsheet.html?highlight=Variables#global-variables" target="_blank">Solidity documentation</a>.

## ⭐️ Assignment

1. Create a new public state variable called `blockNumber`.
2. Inside the function `doSomething()`, assign the value of the current block number to the state variable `blockNumber`.

Tip: Look into the global variables section of the Solidity documentation to find out how to read the current block number.
