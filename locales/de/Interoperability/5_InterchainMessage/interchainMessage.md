In this section we will create a contract that will send a "hello world" message between two blockchains.

## Constructor

The first thing you will need to create in the `constructor` for the function. This will allow you to set the `Gateway` and `Gas Service` contracts we discussed in the previous sections.

When deploying the contract you will pass in the address of the `Gateway` and `GasService` for Ethereum Sepolia those addresses are `0xe432150cce91c13a887f7D836923d5597adD8E31` for the Gateway and `0xbE406F0189A0B4cf3A05C286473D23791Dd44Cc6` for the Gas Service.

## Send Interchain Message

Now that the constructor has set the relevant Axelar addresses needed to trigger an interchain transaction you can move on to the `setRemoteValue()`, which will trigger this transaction.

This function takes three parameters:

1. `_destinationChain`: The chain which the transaction is going to
2. `_destinationAddress`: The address on the destination chain the transaction will execute at
3. `_message`: The message being passed to the destination chain

First, you have a `require` statement which ensure that the `msg.value` contains a value. This `msg.value` will be used to pay the `GasService`. If no funds were sent, then the transaction should be reverted as the transaction cannot execute on the Axelar blockchain and destination chain without any gas.

Next, you encode the `_message` that was passed in. Notice that the `_message` is set as a `string` type. Axelar expects this message to be submitted as a `bytes` type so to convert the `string` to `bytes` you simply pass it through `abi.encode()`.

Now, with your message encoded you can begin to interact with the `GasService` and the `Gateway`

To pay for the entire interchain transaction you will trigger the function `payNativeGasForContractCall`, which is defined in the `GasService`.

This function needs the parameters explained earlier in the GasService section. The `sender` for this transaction will be this contract, which is `address(this)`. The `destinationChain` and `destinationAddress` can simply be passed in from this functions parameters, the `payload` is the encoded \_message we wrote earlier. Finally, you need to specify what the refund address is, this can be the address that triggers this function, which you get by writing `msg.sender`.

Once you trigger this function you will have successfully send a transaction from the source chain via Axelar to the destination chain! But there is still is one final step that needs to be complete.

### Receive Message on Destination Chain

On the destination chain the inbound interchain transaction needs to be picked up and handled by the `AxelarExecutable`'s `_execute()` function.

The `_execute()` function is defined in the `AxelarExecutable` contract so when defining this function you must remember to include the `override` keyword.

This function takes three parameters.

1. `_sourceChain`: The blockchain which the transaction has originated from
2. `_sourceAddress`: The address on the source chain which the transaction has been sent from
3. `_payload`: The message that has been sent from the source chain

The first thing that needs to be done in this contract is to get access to your `message` that was sent. Recall, before sending the message it was sent through `abi.encode()` to convert the message from type `string` to type `bytes`. To convert your message back from type `bytes` to type `string` simply pass the `_payload` to the function `abi.decode()` and specify that you want the `_payload` decoded to type `string`. This will return the message as a string.

Now that you have your message as a type string you can set the `sourceChain` and `sourceAddress` storage variables as `_sourceChain` and `_sourceAddress` to have an easy reference to the data that was passed in. You can also emit the `Executed` event with the `sourceAddress` and `message` event that you just decoded.

Great! At this point you are now handling the interchain transaction on the destination chain.

To interact with this contract make sure you deploy it on at least two blockchains so that you can call `setRemoteValue()` from the one chain and then have the `_execute()` function automatically triggered on another chain. You will be able to query the `sourceChain` and `sourceAddress` variables on the destination chain to ensure that the interchain execution worked correctly.
