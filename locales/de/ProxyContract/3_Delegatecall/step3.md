# Delegate call

It's a special variant of a **message call**, which is identical to a message call apart from the fact that the code at the target address is executed in the context of the calling contract so **msg.sender** and **msg.value** do not change their values.

This means that a contract can dynamically load code from a different address at runtime.

The storage, the current address and balance still refer to the calling contract, only the code is taken from the called address.

So when a **Proxy** delegates calls to the Logic contract, every storage modification will impact the storage of Logic contract.
