# This is a repo of tutorials for the Remix's LearnEth Plugin

### To use these tutorials:

**1. Open Remix**

https://remix.ethereum.org

**2. In the plugin manager activate LEARNETH**

**3. Go to the Learneth plugin and these tutorials will load by default**

**4. You may need to sign into Github especially during an in-person workshop**

Github will block too many requests from the same location, unless you are signed into Github and have input your token.  Generally, this is only an issue during in person workshops, when there can be many requests from the same location.

To input your Github token:

```
- In one browser window - go to https://remix.ethereum.org and go to the settings tab
- In another browser window go to: 

https://github.com/settings/tokens 

and create a new token and save it in Remix in the you just opened on the settings tab.
```
