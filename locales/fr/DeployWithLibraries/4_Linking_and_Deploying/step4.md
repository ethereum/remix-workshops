Switch to the `Deploy & Run` module
![Run transaction](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/raw/master/DeployWithLibraries/4_Linking_and_Deploying/images/remix_runtransaction.png "Run Transaction")

- Select the Remix VM Environment and select the `sampleContract` contract in the list of compiled contracts.

- Click on `Deploy`

The terminal should output something like `creation of sample errored: <address> is not a valid address. Please check the provided address is valid.`
That is expected: **We have set `autoDeployLib` to false, so Remix expects to have an address and not just `<address>`**

So we need deploy the library to get its address.

- Select the library `aLib` in the list of compiled contract and hit `deploy`

  ![Choose aLib](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/raw/master/DeployWithLibraries/4_Linking_and_Deploying/images/contract_alib.png "Choose aLib")

- Click the clipboard icon to copy the address of the library.

  ![Copy lib1](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/raw/master/DeployWithLibraries/4_Linking_and_Deploying/images/alib_copy.png "Copy")

- Paste it into the **contract sample's** metadata JSON.

- Reselect the `sampleContract` contract in the `Run transaction` module and hit deploy.

- Deploy should now be successful.
