## Workspaces help organize your separate projects.

If this is your first time to Remix, a Workspace named **default_workspace** is loaded in the File Explorer.

The **default_workspace** has three Solidity (.sol) files in the contracts folder. Remix has a number of other templates. When you load a template, it goes into a Workspace. To go between Workspaces, use the select box at the top of the File Explorer.

But Workspaces are not only for templates. When cloning a repo into Remix, the files will be put into a Workspace.

Let's create a new Workspace

1. At the top of the File Explorer, click the hamburger icon (the 3 horizontal lines). Read through the commands and tools in this menu.

2. Select **+ Create** (the first choice).

3. In the modal the comes up, choose one of the templates.

Notice that in this popup menu, you can clone a repo. Managing a Git repo happens in the DGit plugin. You can also create Github actions with the three workflow choices in the popup menu.
