Let's go back to our contract.
Please make sure the `solidity compiler` and `Deploy & Run Transactions` are activated.

Alternatively, you can click on `Solidity` from the `Home Page` **Environments** section.

- Compile the contract from the `solidity compiler`.
- Go to the `Deploy & Run Transactions` and make sure `SimpleStore` is selected contract.
- In the textbox to the right of `Deploy`, input a positive integer.
- Click on `Deploy`.

In the next step, we'll watch the deployment in the debugger.
