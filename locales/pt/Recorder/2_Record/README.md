# Setting up a tedious series of steps

## Following this could get tedious but that's the point.

We are going to:

- Deploy a voting contract where there are 3 proposals input in the constructor.
- Give voting privileges to 2 additional address (so we have a total of 3 voting addresses).
- Have one address vote for proposal 1 (0-based index) and the other two vote for proposal 2.

1. Take the 3_Ballot.sol from the sample solidity files and compile it.  Then go to the **Deploy & Run** Module.

2. Select the **JavaScript VM** Environment.

3. In the constructor's parameter - put in **["0x5031000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "0x5032000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", "0x5033000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"]** Then click the **Deploy** button.

4. Open up the deployed contract.

5. In the **vote** function put in 2.  This means that you as the msg.sender & chairperson are voting for proposal at position 2, which is the last proposal in our list.

6. Now you need to give other addresses the right to vote.  Select another address in the **account** pulldown and copy it and then **go back to the 1st address**.  Paste the copy address into the textbox next to the giveRightToVote function.  And again, select another address and copy it and **then go back to the 1st address** again and paste it into giveRightToVote.

7. Now you have 3 addresses with the right to vote.

8. Switch to one of the addresses that you gave the right to vote and vote for proposal **1**.  (Put **1** in the textbox next to the vote function).  And then switch to the other address and vote for proposal **2** with that one.

9. Open up the **Transactions recorded** section of the module - by clicking on the caret. Click the hard disk icon in the **Transactions recorded** section to save your steps.

10. You will get a modal window that tells you it wants to save a file called **scenario.json**.  Click OK.

11. Click on the function **winningProposal** to confirm that the final proposal won - which is the proposal at position 2 in the array. **0: uint256: winningProposal_ 2**
