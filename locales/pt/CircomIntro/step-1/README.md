Welcome to this beginner-level tutorial on Circom using Remix. In this tutorial, you'll learn the basics of Circom, a domain-specific language used for creating arithmetic circuits.

**What is Circom?**

Circom is a language designed for writing arithmetic circuits that can be used in zero-knowledge proofs, particularly zk-SNARKs. It allows developers to define complex mathematical circuits that can prove knowledge of certain data without revealing it.

**Why Use Remix-IDE for Circom?**

- **Ease of Use:** Remix-IDE provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies the development process.
- **Integrated Tools:** With plugins like `circuit-compiler`, you can compile Circom code, perform trusted setups, compute witnesses, and generate proofs all within the same environment.
- **No Installation Required:** As a web-based IDE, you can start coding immediately without setting up a local development environment.

In the next steps, we'll guide you through setting up Remix-IDE for Circom development and help you write your first circuit.
