Welcome to this interactive Solidity course for beginners.

In this first section, we will give you a short preview of the concepts we will cover in this course, look at an example smart contract, and show you how you can interact with this contract in the Remix IDE.

This contract is a counter contract that has the functionality to increase, decrease, and return the state of a counter variable.

If we look at the top of the contract, we can see some information about the contract like the license (line 1), the Solidity version (line 2), as well as the keyword `contract` and it's name, `Counter` (line 4). We will cover these concepts in the next section about the **Basic Syntax**.

With `uint public count` (line 5) we declare a state variable of the type `uint` with the visibility `public`. We will cover these concepts in our sections about **Variables**, **Primitive Data Types**, and **Visibility**.

We then create a `get` function (line 8) that is defined with the `view` keyword and returns a `uint` type. Specifically, it returns the `count` variable. This contract has two more functions, an `inc` (line 13) and `dec` (line 18) function that increases or decreases our count variable.
We will talk about these concepts in our sections about **Functions - Reading and Writing to a State Variable** and **Functions - View and pure**.

## Compile and Deploy through Remix

**GIF** Interacting with the contract: <img src="https://github.com/dacadeorg/remixMedia/blob/main/solidity-beginner-course/introduction.gif?raw=true" alt="Compile and deploy contract" width="300"/>

1. We can compile your `Counter` contract in the "Solidity compiler" module of the Remix IDE.

2. In the "Deploy & run transactions" module, we select our contract "Counter" in the contract input field and click on the "Deploy" button.

3. We expand the token contract functions in the IDE, and test its `get`, `inc`, and `dec` functions.

## ⭐️ Assignment

Throughout this course, we will give you assignments to test and consolidate your newly acquired knowledge.

Your first assignment is to:

1. Compile this contract.
2. Deploy it to the Remix VM.
3. Interact with your contract.
