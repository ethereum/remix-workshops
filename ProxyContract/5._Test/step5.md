# Let's test what we've learned

  - Add to the contract **LogicContract** a public function named **getNumber** which returns 10

  - Add to the proxy contract **ProxyContract**:
    - an internal state variable that holds the logic contract's address.
    - a constructor that takes the logic contract's address as a parameter and stores it in the state variable.
    
    ProxyContract should take an address of LogicContract as a first parameter.

   Good Luck!
