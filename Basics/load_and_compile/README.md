Let's load a file from the File Explorer into the Editor.

1. In the icon panel, click ![file explorer icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/load_and_compile/images/files1.png "file explorer icon") , the File Explorer's icon.

2. Make sure you are in the **default_workspace**.

3. Open the contracts folder and click on **2_Owner.sol** in the contracts folder. Click it. The file will appear in a tab in the main panel.

7. In the icon panel, click the **Solidity Compiler** ![solidity compiler icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/load_and_compile/images/solidity1.png "solidity compiler icon"). The Solidity compiler should now be in the side panel.

8. Click the compile button. 
![compile 2_owner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/master/Basics/load_and_compile/images/compile2owner.png "compile 2_Owner") 

9. Compiling can also be triggered by hitting **CTRL + S**. 

The spinner will turn while the file is compiling.  

**Note:** The spinner also turns when the compiler itself is loading.  To choose a **different version of Solidity**, go to the select box at the top of the plugin.
