In the **main panel** of Remix, make sure you see the **landing page**.  To navigate to the landing page, click the Remix icon ![Remix icon](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/blob/master/Basics/1._Interface_Introduction/images/remix-logo.png?raw=true "Remix icon") on the top of the icon panel.

- In the **Environments** section of the **landing page**, click the **Solidity** button.  This button will activate a number of plugins - you’ll see them in the icon panel (if they haven't already been activated).

- Alternatively, you can activate plugins one at a time with the plugin manager. ![plugin manager](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-workshops/blob/master/Basics/1._Interface_Introduction/images/plugin1.png?raw=true "plugin manager icon")
