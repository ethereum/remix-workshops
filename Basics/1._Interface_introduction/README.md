- In the **Environments** section of the **landing page**, click the **Solidity** button.  This button will activate a number of plugins - youâ€™ll see them in the icon panel (if they haven't already been activated).

- Alternatively, you can activate plugins one at a time with the plugin manager. ![plugin manager](./images/plugin1.png?raw=true "plugin manager icon")
