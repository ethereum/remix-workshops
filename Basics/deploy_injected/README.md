## Deploying to a public test net.

1. Download the browser plugin **MetaMask**. 

2. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser. Sign in and choose a test network. 

3. Get some test ETH for that network. If, for example, you had selected Goerli Network then, search for `Goerli faucet` and you'll find a website where (after jumping through some hoops), you'll get some test ETH. 

2. Go back to Remix. In  **Deploy & Run**, in the **Environment** pulldown, choose **Injected Provider**.

3. Make sure you see the 2_Owner.sol as a choice in the **CONTRACT** select box, then click the **Deploy** button.  If the **CONTRACT** select box was empty, you'll need to compile 2_Owner again.  Make sure it is the active file in the **editor** and then go to the **Solidity Compiler** to compile it.  

5. You'll see the MetaMask popup asking you to pay for the transactions.

And with that you have finished this tutorial.  You now have experience with opening, compiling, deploying and interacting with Smart Contracts in Remix IDE.
