## Deploying to a public test net.

1. Download the browser plugin **MetaMask**. 

2. Click the MetaMask icon in your browser. Sign in and choose a test network. 

3. Get some test ETHER for that network. If, for example, you had selected Goerli Network then, search for `Goerli faucet` and you'll find a website where you can get some test ether. 

2. Go back to Remix. In  **Deploy & Run**, in the **Environment** pulldown, choose **Injected Web3**.

3. See if you can deploy your compiled 2_Owner.sol to the test net that you have just chosen. If you see the 2_Owner.sol as a choice in the **CONTRACT** select box, click the **Deploy** button.  
    - If you see nothing in this select box, you'll need to compile ballot.sol again.  And if you do need to compile 2_Owner.sol again,  make sure it is the active file in the **editor** and then go to the **Solidity Compiler** to compile it.  

    - And then, go to the **Deploy & Run** plugin and deploy to the network you've chosen in step 2.

5. You'll see the MetaMask popup asking you to pay for the transactions.

And with that you have finished this tutorial.  You now have experience with opening, compiling, deploying and interacting with Smart Contracts in Remix IDE.
